<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This application is a text editor that runs in the browser. The editor is a single page application that meets the criteria for a Progressive Web App. Additionally the application features a number of data persistence techniques that will serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.


### Built With

* [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB)
* [idb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb)
* [webpack] (https://webpack.js.org/)
